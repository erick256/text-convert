# text-convert
Simple c++ program that converts text in a file to ASCII and back to normal text.

Example code is in TMain.cpp. The program converts the text in test.txt to ASCII text and the reverts it back to normal text.

Program is functional but with some issues: Converting a file to ASCII that has already been converted will mess up the data thus rendering it useless. Same thing goes for when revert ASCII back to text. 

I would go ahead and fix these issues if I were to want to improve on the project but this project was mainly to refamiliarize myself with C++ after a hiatus from programming in this language.
